# JSON---AJAX
- This project aimed to teach me the fundamentals of JSON and AJAX, and how they both work coherently together. I tried to involve 5 stages of AJAX requests in the JavaScript code. They are as follows:
  - 1. Initialises a new XMLHttpRequest
  - 2. Opens the new request, to state request type (GET or POST) and url direction.
  - 3. Request onload function. What happens to the data once loaded, through an external function.
  - 4. Request Send.
  - 5. Error Handling with status codes.
